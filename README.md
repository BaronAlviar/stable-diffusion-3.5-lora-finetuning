# üé® Stable Diffusion 3.5 LoRA Fine-Tuning Framework

A comprehensive, modular framework for fine-tuning Stable Diffusion 3.5 models using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This repository enables you to create custom AI image generators tailored to your specific artistic style, objects, or concepts.

## ü§î What is Text-to-Image Generation?

Text-to-image generation is a revolutionary AI technology that creates images from written descriptions. Instead of drawing or photographing, you simply describe what you want to see, and the AI generates a corresponding image.

**Examples:**
- Input: "A serene mountain landscape at sunset with purple clouds"
- Output: A beautiful, photorealistic image matching your description

### Why Fine-tune Stable Diffusion?

While pre-trained models like Stable Diffusion 3.5 are incredibly powerful, they might not perfectly capture:
- **Your artistic style** (e.g., watercolor paintings, anime style, vintage photographs)
- **Specific objects or characters** (your pet, a logo, architectural style)
- **Custom concepts** (fictional characters, product designs, artistic techniques)

Fine-tuning allows you to teach the model your specific visual language while maintaining its general capabilities.

## üöÄ What This Repository Does

This framework provides a **complete solution** for customizing Stable Diffusion 3.5 models:

## üìã Requirements

### Hardware Requirements
- **Minimum**: GPU with 15GB VRAM (Google Colab)
- **Recommended**: GPU with 16GB+ VRAM
- **Cloud Options**: Google Colab, Paperspace, RunPod, or AWS/GCP instances

### Software Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- CUDA 11.8+ or 12.x
- Git

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gokhaneraslan/stable-diffusion-3.5-lora-finetuning.git
cd stable-diffusion-3.5-lora-finetuning
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Configure Accelerator (Crucial Step)

The training script relies on Hugging Face `accelerate`. To ensure it uses the correct settings (like mixed precision), you need to configure it once per machine.

Run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
accelerate config
```
This will launch an interactive setup wizard. For most single-GPU setups (like Google Colab or a standard desktop), you can follow the answers below.

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to see the `accelerate config` example dialogue</strong></summary>

```text
In which compute environment are you running?
[0] This machine
[1] AWS (Amazon SageMaker)
-> 0 (This machine)

Which type of machine are you using?
[0] No distributed training
[1] multi-CPU
[2] multi-GPU
...
-> 0 (No distributed training, if you are on a single GPU)

Do you want to run your training on CPU only? [yes/NO]:
-> NO

Do you wish to optimize your script with torch dynamo? [yes/NO]:
-> NO

Do you want to use DeepSpeed? [yes/NO]:
-> NO

What GPU(s) (by id) should be used for training on this machine? (e.g. '0,1,2,3', 'all') [all]:
-> all (or 0)

Would you like to enable numa efficiency? [yes/NO]:
-> NO (This is safe for most systems)

Do you wish to use mixed precision?
[0] no
[1] fp16
[2] bf16
...
-> 2 (bf16, to match our project's config)

```
After answering, `accelerate` will save a configuration file, and you won't see warnings when you run `accelerate launch`.

### Step 5: Hugging Face Authentication (Crucial Step)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** The Stable Diffusion 3.5 models require authentication. To download them, you must first agree to the license terms on the model's Hugging Face page and then log in.

1. Visit [Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium model page](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3.5-medium) or [Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large model page](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3.5-large)
2.  Accept the license terms
3.  Get your access token from [HF Settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
4.  Login via terminal:
    ```bash
    huggingface-cli login
    ```
    
### Step 6: Prepare Your Dataset

The training script requires a specific dataset format. For a detailed guide on creating a high-quality dataset from scratch, please refer to the **[Text-to-Image Dataset Preparation Toolkit](https://github.com/gokhaneraslan/text_to_image_dataset_toolkit).

For a quick test, ensure your dataset directory contains an `images/` subdirectory and a `metadata.jsonl` file..**

## üìÅ Dataset Preparation

Your dataset should follow this structure:
```
MyDataset/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image1.jpg
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image2.png
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ metadata.jsonl
```

### metadata.jsonl Format
Each line should be a JSON object:
```json
{"file_name": "image1.jpg", "text": "A detailed description of the image"}
{"file_name": "image2.png", "text": "Another descriptive caption"}
```

### Dataset Tips
- **Quality over Quantity**: 50-200 high-quality images often work better than thousands of poor ones
- **Consistent Style**: For style training, use images with consistent artistic approach
- **Detailed Captions**: Write descriptive, specific captions (10-50 words per image)
- **Image Resolution**: Use high-resolution images (1024x1024 or higher)

**For comprehensive dataset creation guidance, check out our [Dataset Preparation Toolkit](https://github.com/gokhaneraslan/text_to_image_dataset_toolkit).**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit `configs/training_config.yaml` to customize your training:

```yaml
# Key settings to adjust:
model:
  id: "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3.5-medium"  # or 3.5-large
  use_quantization: true  # Set to false if you have plenty of VRAM

paths:
  output_dir: "/path/to/your/outputs"
  dataset_path: "/path/to/your/dataset"

training:
  num_epochs: 20          # Increase for more training
  batch_size: 1           # Increase if you have more VRAM
  
lora:
  rank: 32               # Higher = more parameters, better quality
  alpha: 64              # Scaling factor for LoRA
```

## üöÇ Training Your Model

### Start Training
```bash
accelerate launch train.py --config_path configs/training_config.yaml
```

### Monitor Progress
- Check console output for loss values
- Validation images saved to `output_dir/validation_images/` (if enabled)
- TensorBoard logs in `output_dir/logs/`

```bash
# View training progress with TensorBoard
tensorboard --logdir output_dir/logs
```

### Training Time Estimates
- **Google Colab**: ~1-2 hours (varies with availability)

## üé® Generating Images

After training completes, use your fine-tuned model:

```bash
python inference.py \
    --lora_checkpoint_dir "output_dir/checkpoint-final" \
    --prompt "Your creative prompt here" \
    --output_path "my_generated_image.png" \
    --steps 28 \
    --guidance_scale 7.0
```

### Example Prompts
```bash
# For an anime-style model
python inference.py \
    --lora_checkpoint_dir "checkpoints/anime_style" \
    --prompt "anime style, a girl with blue hair in a magical forest, detailed, beautiful lighting" \
    --output_path "anime_girl.png"

# For a product visualization model
python inference.py \
    --lora_checkpoint_dir "checkpoints/product_viz" \
    --prompt "modern minimalist chair in a bright living room, professional photography" \
    --output_path "chair_visualization.png"
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. Out of Memory (OOM) Errors
**Symptoms**: CUDA out of memory, training crashes
**Solutions**:
```yaml
# In your config file:
training:
  batch_size: 1                    # Reduce batch size
  gradient_accumulation_steps: 8   # Increase to maintain effective batch size
model:
  use_quantization: true          # Enable 4-bit quantization
```

### 2. "Model is Gated" or HTTP 401 Unauthorized Error
**Symptoms**: Cannot download model files
**Solutions**:
1. Accept license at [Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium model page](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3.5-medium) or [Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large model page](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3.5-large)
2. Run `huggingface-cli login` with valid token
3. Ensure token has read permissions

### 3. Slow Training Speed
**Symptoms**: Very slow training progress
**Solutions**:
- Ensure CUDA is properly installed: `python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"`
- Verify mixed precision is enabled in accelerate config
- Check if quantization is enabled in config
- Monitor GPU usage with `nvidia-smi`

### 4. Poor Generated Image Quality
**Symptoms**: Blurry, artifacts, doesn't match training data
**Solutions**:
- **Increase training epochs**: Try 30-50 epochs
- **Improve dataset quality**: Better captions, consistent style
- **Adjust LoRA rank**: Increase from 32 to 64 or 128
- **Lower learning rate**: Reduce all learning rates by 50%

### 5. "Accelerate Not Configured" Warning
**Symptoms**: Warning messages about accelerate configuration
**Solution**: Run `accelerate config` and follow the prompts

### 6. Dataset Loading Errors
**Symptoms**: "No valid image-caption pairs found"
**Solutions**:
- Verify `metadata.jsonl` format (each line must be valid JSON)
- Ensure image files exist in `images/` subdirectory
- Check file permissions and paths
- Validate JSON format: `python -m json.tool metadata.jsonl`

## üìä Understanding Training Metrics

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Loss**: Should generally decrease over time (0.1-0.01 is typical)
- **Learning Rate**: Should follow your scheduler (cosine/linear decay)
- **Steps per Second**: Indicates training speed

### When to Stop Training
- Loss plateaus for many epochs
- Validation images show good quality
- Signs of overfitting (loss decreases but quality doesn't improve)

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Memory Optimization
```yaml
# For limited VRAM
training:
  batch_size: 1
  gradient_accumulation_steps: 8
  mixed_precision: "bf16"
model:
  use_quantization: true
```

### Quality Optimization
```yaml
# For better results (requires more VRAM)
lora:
  rank: 64        # or 128
  alpha: 128      # or 256
training:
  num_epochs: 30
optimizer:
  transformer_lr: 1.0e-6  # Lower learning rate
```

## Introduction

In the world of AI art, flexibility and efficiency are key. This repository aims to provide you with the tools necessary to fine-tune Stable Diffusion models quickly and effectively. By utilizing LoRA, you can adapt existing models to better suit your artistic needs without requiring extensive computational resources.

## Features

- **Modular Framework**: Easily integrate new features or customize existing ones.
- **Memory-Efficient**: Designed to run on consumer-grade GPUs, making AI art accessible to everyone.
- **Custom Models**: Create models tailored to your specific artistic style, objects, or concepts.
- **Support for Various Workflows**: Ideal for artistic workflows, character design, product visualization, and more.
- **Generative AI**: Harness the power of generative AI for image creation.

## Installation

To get started, you need to install the required dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BaronAlviar/stable-diffusion-3.5-lora-finetuning.git
   cd stable-diffusion-3.5-lora-finetuning
   ```

2. **Install Requirements**:

   Use pip to install the necessary Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Your Environment**:

   Make sure your environment is set up for GPU usage. This might involve installing CUDA and cuDNN if you haven't already.

## Usage

Once you have the framework set up, you can begin fine-tuning your models. Here’s a basic guide to get you started:

1. **Prepare Your Dataset**:

   Collect images that reflect the style or concepts you want to train on. Organize them in a directory.

2. **Configure the Training Parameters**:

   Edit the configuration file to set your training parameters. This includes batch size, learning rate, and the number of epochs.

3. **Start Fine-Tuning**:

   Run the training script with the following command:

   ```bash
   python train.py --config config.yaml
   ```

4. **Monitor Training**:

   Keep an eye on the training logs to ensure everything is running smoothly.

## Fine-Tuning Process

The fine-tuning process involves several key steps:

### Step 1: Data Preparation

Your dataset should be diverse enough to capture the essence of the style you want to replicate. You can use images from your own collection or publicly available datasets.

### Step 2: Configuring Parameters

The configuration file allows you to specify:

- **Learning Rate**: Controls how quickly the model adapts to new data.
- **Batch Size**: Number of samples processed before the model's internal parameters are updated.
- **Epochs**: The number of times the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset.

### Step 3: Training

Run the training script as mentioned earlier. Depending on your dataset size and GPU capabilities, this process may take some time.

### Step 4: Evaluation

After training, evaluate your model's performance. Use a validation dataset to check how well the model generates images based on your input prompts.

## Examples

Here are some examples of what you can achieve with this framework:

### Example 1: Character Design

By fine-tuning the model on a dataset of character illustrations, you can generate unique characters tailored to your vision.

### Example 2: Product Visualization

Train the model on product images to create realistic visualizations for marketing or design purposes.

### Example 3: Artistic Styles

Capture the essence of famous artists by training the model on their works. Generate images that reflect those styles while maintaining your creative input.
